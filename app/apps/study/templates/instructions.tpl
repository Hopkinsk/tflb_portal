	<span class="col-sm-12">

		<h3 class="underline"> What To Fill In: </h3>
		<p> Days in which you drank or used marijuana, please enter in the total number of drinks you had (as a whole number) and select ‘Yes’ for marijuana use.  If you use marijuana daily, please check the box that’s marked ‘Daily marijuana use’. </p>

		We want you to record your drinking on the calendar using Standard Drinks. 
		<p> For example, if you had 6 beers, enter the number 6 for that day. If you drank two or more different kinds of alcoholic beverages in a day such as 2 beers and 3 glasses of wine, you would enter the number 5 for that day.</p>

	<h3 class="underline"> Your Best Estimate: </h3>
	<p> We realize it isn’t easy to recall things with 100% accuracy.  <br>
	If you are not sure whether you drank 5 or 7 drinks or whether you used marijuana on a Thursday or a Friday, give it your best guess! What is important is that 5 or 7 drinks are very different from 1 or 2 drinks or 15 drinks. The goal is to get a sense of how frequently you drank or used marijuana, how much you drank, and detect patterns of use. </p>

	<h3 class="underline"> Helpful Hints </h3>
	<p>
	If you’ve had special occasions such as a birthday, a party, or celebration in the last 90 days – enter those events on the calendar to help jog your memory. To add or edit events, press the “Add/Edit Events” *insert image of button here*  button at the top of the page. 

	If you have regular drinking or marijuana use patterns you can use these dates to help recall your use. For example, you may have a daily or a weekend only pattern, or use more in the summer or on trips.

	  <li> Try to be as accurate as possible </li>
	  <li> We recognize you won’t have perfect memory. That’s okay! </li>
