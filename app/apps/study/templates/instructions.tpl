	If you’ve had special occasions such as a birthday, a party, or celebration in the last 90 days – enter those events on the calendar to help jog your memory. 

	Press the <b>Add Events</b> button at the top of the calendar to add/edit events 

	If you have regular drinking or marijuana use patterns you can use these dates to help recall your use. For example, you may have a daily or a weekend-only pattern, or use more in the summer or on trips.

	We realize it isn’t easy to recall things with 100% accuracy.  </li> 
	If you are not sure whether you drank 5 or 7 drinks or whether you used marijuana on a Thursday or a Friday, give it your 
	<b> best guess!</b><br>
	What is important is that 5 or 7 drinks are very different from 1 or 2 drinks or 15 drinks. <b> The goal is to get a sense of how frequently you drank or used marijuana, how much you drank, and detect patterns of use.</b> </p>

	<ul>
	  <li> Try to be as accurate as possible </li>
	  <li> We recognize you won’t have perfect memory. That’s okay! </li>
