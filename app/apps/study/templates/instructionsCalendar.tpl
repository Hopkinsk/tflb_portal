<h4 class=""> Instructions </h4>

<p> To help us evaluate your alcohol and marijuana use, we need to get an idea of what your use was like in the past 90 days. To do this, we would like you to fill out a calendar. </p>

<ul>
  <li> Try to be as accurate as possible </li>
  <li> We recognize you won’t have perfect memory. That’s okay! </li>
</ul>


<h4> What to fill in: </h4>
<p> Days in which you drank alcohol and/or used marijuana please enter the total number of drinks (as a whole number) and select 'Yes' for marijuana. 

You will record your drinking on the calendar using the <b> Standard Drinks </b> guide. 


<p> For example, if you had 6 beers, enter the number 6 for that day. If you drank two or more different kinds of alcoholic beverages in a day such as 2 beers and 3 glasses of wine, you would enter the number 5 for that day.
To record your marijuana use, just click “Yes” on days when you used marijuana. All of the days on the calendar will be set to “No” marijuana use unless you indicate otherwise.</p>



<h3> Your best estimate: </h3>
<p> We realize it isn’t easy to recall things with 100% accuracy.
If you are not sure whether you drank 5 or 7 drinks or whether you used marijuana on a Thursday or a Friday, give it your best guess! What is important is that 5 or 7 drinks are very different from 1 or 2 drinks or 15 drinks. The goal is to get a sense of how frequently you drank or used marijuana, how much you drank, and your patterns of use. </p>



<h3> Helpful Hints </h3>
<p>

If you’ve had special occasions such as a birthday, a party, or celebration in the last 90 days – enter those events on the calendar to help jog your memory.
If you have regular drinking or marijuana use patterns you can use these dates to help recall your use. For example, you may have a daily or weekend/weekday pattern, or use more in the summer or on trips.
